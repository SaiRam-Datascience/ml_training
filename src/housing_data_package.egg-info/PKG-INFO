# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## To excute the script

Step 1 - Environment setup

- You can create the environment required for this setup by running the below command by navigating into the current directory in the shell.

   root   
   ```conda env create -f env.yml```

- Then activate it by running the below command
 
  root

  ```conda activate mle-dev```

Step 2 - Run the file

- You can type the below command in the shell.
 
  python

  ```python nonstandardcode.py```
