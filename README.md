# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## To excute the script
python < scriptname.py :# ml_training

# executing the code
 - check the conda environments using conda info --envs
 - check the list of the environments you have conda env list
 - if the environmenr is not existed create the environment
 - if the environment is existed activate using conda activate environment_name
 - create the python file 
 - execute the python file using python3 pythonfilename.py
 - install the required package names using pip3 install package_name
